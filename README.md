# Component Based UI

## Description

***we begin the first of a 4-Phase build of the RESTy application, written in React. In this first phase, our goal is to setup the basic scaffolding of the application, with intent being to add more functionality to the system as we go. This initial build sets up the file structure so that we can progressively build this application in a scalable manner***

Begin with installing and running the application, making note of it’s architecture

The App component serves as the container for all sub-components of this application Leave this component as a Class

The app imports an .scss file to serve as the base design for the site
Header, Footer, Results and Form components are imported from other files using ES6 import syntax
Each of the components use their own .scss file for styling

The component should:

Call back to the component via function sent down through a prop so that the app can begin the process
The component should show mock API results

### RESTy Phase 2: Retrieving User Input and Managing State

#### In phase 2, we will be receiving user input in preparation of connecting to live APIs, using the useState() hook in our functional components

## Application Flow:

- User enters an API URL.
- Chooses a REST Method.
- Clicks the “Go” button.
- Application fetches data from the URL given, with the method specified.
- Displays the response headers and results separately.
- Both headers and results should be “pretty printed” JSON.

### Technical Requirements


**Note:the API mocked with “fake” data** 

#### Component Hierarchy and Application Architecture:


**index.js - Entry Point**

**App.js - Container**

Holds application state:

- The Request (from the form) and the Response (from the API)
- A class method that can update state

Renders 2 Child Components:

1- Form Component:

- Expects a function to be sent to it as a prop
- Renders a URL entry form
- A selection of REST methods to choose from (“get” should be the default)
- The active selection should be displayed/styled differently than the others
- Renders a Textarea to allow the user to type in a JSON object for a POST or PUT request
- On submit
- Send the Form entries back to the App using the method sent down in props
- Form will run the API request
- Toggle the “loading” status before and after the request

2- Results Component

- Conditionally renders “Loading” or the data depending on the status of the request
- Expects the count, headers, results to be sent in as props
- Renders the count
- Renders the Result Headers as “pretty” JSON
- Renders the Result Body as “pretty” JSON

### RESTy Phase 3: Connect RESTy with APIs, running live requests

### Phase 3 Requirements

In phase 3, we will be connecting RESTy to live APIs, fetching and displaying remote data. Our primary focus will be to service GET requests.

**enter URL to an API and issue a GET request so that I can retrieve it’s data, and see the results returned from an API request in my browser in a readable format**

## Application Flow:

- User enters an API URL
- Chooses a REST Method
- Clicks the “Go” button
- Application fetches data from the URL given, with the method specified
- Displays the response headers and results separately
- Both headers and results should be “pretty printed” JSON

**RESTy Phase 4: Track History**

### Phase 4 Requirements

tracking every API call and storing it in history

**Application Flow:**

- User enters an API URL
- Chooses a REST Method
- Clicks the “Go” button
- Application fetches data from the URL given, with the method specified
- Application stores the API request and returned data into state
- Updates the list of previous API calls
- Application Displays the response headers and results separately
- Both headers and results should be “pretty printed” JSON
